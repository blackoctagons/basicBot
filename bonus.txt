Many Chinese philosophers believe that the universe is made from two opposing forces, the Yin and Yang. The panda is one symbol of this philosophy with its contrasting black-and-white fur. The Chinese believe that the gentle nature of the panda demonstrates how the Yin and Yang bring peace and harmony when they are balanced.

ITS PANDAMONIUM!!!!
In kung fu, battle does not force you apart. It brings you together.
Fun Fact: The panda?s diet is 99% Bamboo - It seems that the panda really knows what it likes. Bamboo has a very low nutrient content, so pandas must eat up to 84 pounds of bamboo per day. Occasionally, the panda will stray from its much loved diet of bamboo to eat grass or even small rodents.
"...and curiously upon opening the pharaoh's grave, inside the tomb was inscribed the ancient phrase 'Kwan was here,' indicating a long history of ATS activity, previously unknown to modern science"
